This generator is intended to be utilized with the Offshore Wind ENergy Simulation (OWENS) analysis tool [1]. The input files for this mesh generator are discussed in detail. Turbine components (tower, blades, and struts) are described using existing National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) file formats [2]. A simple input file sizes these basic components and positions them in a hub fixed coordinate frame at arbitrary distances from the origin with arbitrary orientation. VAWTGen generates a mesh of a VAWT consisting of Timoshenko beam elements along with other files describing properties of the VAWT. These files serve as inputs to the OWENS analysis tool. VAWTGen also visualizes the VAWT assembly and mesh to provide a visual confirmation that the VAWT is constructed correctly. Furthermore, VAWTGen can visualize the modal and transient results output by the OWENS analysis tool.","category":"page"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/#Overview-of-VAWTGen-Mesh-Generator","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"Overview of VAWTGen Mesh Generator","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","text":"A VAWT rotor primarily consists of a tower and blade components. The blades may be affixed to the tower at their ends as in the Darrieus and V-VAWT configurations or via struts as in the H-VAWT configuration. Struts may also provide a connection between the tower and blades at any position along the tower and blade spans. The VAWTGen mesh generator is capable of generating VAWTs of arbitrary geometry, including H-type, V-type, and Darrieus configurations shown in Figure 1. The VAWT configuration is discretized from continuous structural components into a finite number of beam elements. Elements span between discrete points in the mesh, known as nodes. Finite element analysis examines the motions of nodes as dictated by the deformation of the beam elements under prescribed boundary conditions. This collection of nodes and elements forms the mesh of the VAWT configuration.","category":"page"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","text":"(Image: ){width=\"2.5990562117235347in\" height=\"1.453332239720035in\"}","category":"page"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","text":"[]{#_bookmark2 .anchor}Figure 1 Illustrations of V, H, and Darrieus VAWT configurationsVAWTGen accepts data files containing the basic geometry of tower, blade, and strut components. Other crucial configuration information is specified such as the elevation of the blade root from the tower root, as well as the radial distance the blade root is positioned from the tower. An arbitrary number of blades may be specified for the configuration. VAWTGen positions the blade roots with equal azimuth spacing about the tower axis. The blades may be rotated into an arbitrary orientation per a sequence of Euler angles input by the user. If required, struts may be inserted between the tower and ablade by specifying a fraction of the tower span and the blade span the strut will span. VAWTGen will insert a straight strut of the appropriate length between the tower and blade components. The geometry of the strut component is specified by a file containing geometric data.With these relatively minimal set of inputs (as illustrated in Figure 2) a VAWT of arbitrary configuration may be created. Therefore, a separate tool is not required for the various types of configurations. VAWTGen provides a convenient means to visualize the VAWT turbine in a wireframe or rendered format. This serves as a quick check for the user to ensure the VAWT has been constructed as intended, and shows the actual turbine configuration that the mesh of beam elements represents. VAWTGen also visualizes the finite element mesh once it is created. VAWTGen identifies points of intersection between the various components and inserts nodes accordingly. These node pairs at points of intersection (i.e. strut to tower, blade to strut, blade to tower) are recorded so appropriate constraint conditions at these joints may be imposed. The orientation of the finite elements in the mesh is also visualized to ensure the elements are positioned and oriented as intended.","category":"page"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","text":"(Image: C:\\\\Users\\\\bcowens\\\\Desktop\\\\meshGenFlow.png){width=\"4.016800087489064in\" height=\"2.6266666666666665in\"}","category":"page"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","text":"[]{#_bookmark3 .anchor}Figure 2 Input and output of VAWTGen mesh generatorOutput includes a mesh file is generated that will be used by the analysis software. By default, the mesh is discretized in the same manner as the geometric description of components as specified in the component data files. The user may further subdivide the mesh by specifying an integer factor to further discretize the geometric data into elements. An elemental data file is also created, containing the structural properties of elements. An orientation file is generated containing the Euler angles representing the orientation of the elements. VAWTGen requires data files be supplied to describe the geometry of the primary turbine components (blades, towers, and struts). A joint file is also generated containing nodal information about joint locations. This file is used to specify general constraints between structural components. A blade file is also generated that contains aerodynamic data andprovides information needed for mapping aerodynamic loads to nodal locations on the structural model, as well as supplying geometry to aerodynamic data and geometry to external aerodynamic modules.The format of the structural component data files is the same as the component files for NREL's FAST code [2]. These files describe the geometry and aerodynamic properties of general turbine components, and there is nothing that restricts their use to horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs) specifically. For example, even though a Darrieus blade is not likely be installed on a HAWT, it is easily described by the NREL's FAST blade geometry file format. This allows existing wind energy design tools to be interfaced with the VAWT analysis tool without the need to consider new file formats. NREL's FAST separates geometrical/structural properties of a blade and aerodynamic properties of a blade into two files and the same approach is employed in the VAWTGen mesh generator.","category":"page"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/#Demonstration","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"Demonstration","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","text":"This section demonstrates the capabilities of the VAWTGen mesh generator.

The VAWTGen source code directory should be added to the MATLAB path, and VAWTGen should be executed from a job directory containing the component data files (.dat and .ipt NREL formats), and the VAWTGen input file described in the following section. The command line input should be executed in the MATLAB command window as:vawtGen(inputFile,outputFileRootName,renderBool,zeroTolerance);For example:vawtGen('snl34m.in','snl34m',true,1.0e-5);Results in execution with \"snl34m.in\" as the main VAWTGen input file. Resulting output files would have the root \"snl34m\", such as \"snl34m.mesh\", \"snl34m.el\", etc. The renderBool produces a rendered surface plot of the turbine if set to true, and no rendered view if set to \"false\". The zeroTolerance variable specifies a tolerance to be considered numerical zero when searching for coincident points in the configuration for identifying locations where joints are to be specified. If excluded from the command line input a default value of 1.0e-6 is used.Command line output from VAWTGen consists of a set of minimum element length ratios to the length of the actual structural component. This allows the user to ensure that element lengths are not too small to cause problems with the structural dynamics simulation. The located joints in the model are also displayed with information of the master and slave node numbers and component types.A variety of examples are available in the \"sampleJobs\" directory distributed with VAWTGen. They may be executed by adding the VAWTGen directory to the MATLAB path and running the \"generateMesh.m\" scripts in the example job directory.A sample command line output is shown

of a VAWT configuration. First, a wire- frame visualization (and surface rendering if requested) is created to allow the user to visually inspect the turbine was constructed as intended. These are shown in Figure 3 through Figure 6. The finite element mesh with node numbering is also visualized as shown in Figure 7.

Finite element mesh with node numbering Figure 8. Finite element mesh with element orientationsVisualization of OWENS Output using VAWTGenA number of visualization options exist in VAWTGen for results obtained with the OWENS analysis tool. This section discusses the available options for modal and transient analysis results. These function are located in the \"vizFiles\" directory of the VAWTGen distribution.Visualization of Static Analysis ResultsThe MATLAB function staticPlotter.m will visualize the deformed mesh from a static analysis. This visualization option shows multiple views of the turbine, with the undeformed mesh, and deformed mesh overlaying. The undeformed mesh is plotted in black, and the deformed mesh is plotted in red. The viz function is executed with the following command line call:staticPlotter(meshFile,resultsFile,scaleFactor);Such that meshFile is the mesh filename (.mesh), resultsFile is the OWENS output file from static analysis (_static.mat), and scaleFactor scales the deformed mesh.Visualization of Modal Analysis ResultsThe MATLAB function viz.m will visualize the mode shapes for a particular mode. This visualization option shows multiple views of the turbine, with the undeformed mesh, 0 degree mode shape, and 90 degree mode shape overlaying. The undeformed mesh is plotted in black, 0 degree mode shape in red, and 90 degree mode shape in blue. The viz function is executed with the following command line call:viz(meshFile,resultsFile,selectedMode,scaleFactor);Such that meshFile is the mesh filename (.mesh), resultsFile is the OWENS output file from modal analysis (.out), selectedMode is an integer mode number, and scaleFactor scales the mode shape deformation.An example of an actual viz function execution is: viz(\\'snl34m.mesh\\',\\'snl34m.out\\',2,3) The resulting plot is shown in Figure 9 below:[]{#bookmark21 .anchor}![C:\\Users\\bcowens\\Desktop\\exportfig\\modefirstas.png](figs/VAWTGenUserGuide/image12.png){width=\"2.5578937007874014in\" height=\"2.013333333333333in\"}[]{#_bookmark20 .anchor}Figure 9 Mode shape visualization using viz.mA similar capability exists for generating animated mode shapes. The vizAnimateModal function is utilized in the following manner:vizAnimateModal(meshFile,resultsFile,selectedMode,sf,outFileName);All the input parameters are the same as those for viz, however, the last parameter specifies a file name for a AVI movie file.Visualization of Transient Analysis ResultsA visualization option of transient results as an animation of the motion history of the turbine structure is accomplished via the vizAnimateTransient function. The command line argument is executed as:vizAnimateTransient(meshFile,uData,sf,outFileName);Such that mesh file is the mesh filename (.mesh), uData is an n x m array holding displacement data for n degrees of freedom at m time steps, and sf is the deformation scale factor for the structural mesh. The AVI movie file is generated using outFileName.","category":"page"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/#VAWTGen-Output-Files","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"VAWTGen Output Files","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","text":"The following output files are generated to serve as input for the OWENS analysis tool:","category":"page"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","text":"OWENS main input file (.owens)\nBeam mesh file (.mesh)\nElement property file (.el)\nElement orientation file (.ort)\nJoint file (.jnt)\nBoundary conditions file (.bc)\nBlade data file (.bld)","category":"page"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","text":"Additionally, a log file describing the junctions of various structural components is generated in a .out output file.","category":"page"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/#OWENS-Main-Input-File-(.owens)","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"OWENS Main Input File (.owens)","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"VAWTGenUserGuide/","page":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","title":"Legacy VAWTGen Guide","text":"The OWENS main input file is generated with the following format:Here, the root file name of \"vawt\" was specified at the command line input for VAWTGen.

This structural dynamics finite element analysis tool is intended to be used for the analysis of vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) on a floating platform, and is used in conjunction with the VAWTGen mesh generator described in a separate user manual[1]. An overview of the OWENS analysis tool is presented. The execution, analysis modes, input files, and resulting output files for OWENS are discussed in detail. Visualization options for modal and transient analysis are also presented. Version 1.0 of OWENS presents a structural dynamics tool for modal and transient analysis of an arbitrary VAWT structure affixed to a floating platform.

The finite element method provides a means to satisfy these general requirements. If a sufficiently robust element is developed, a mesh (collection of elements) of an arbitrary VAWT configuration may be constructed via a mesh generator.

Next, displacement motions of the turbine may be provided to aerodynamic and hydrodynamic modules to calculate loads on the turbine.
